## 🔧 Integration Steps

### 1. Database Migration

First, run the database migration to create the required tables:

```sql
-- Connect to your Supabase database and run:
\i exam_room_management_migration.sql
```

Or copy and paste the contents of `exam_room_management_migration.sql` into your Supabase SQL editor.

### 2. Start the Server

The exam room router is now integrated into the main application:

```bash
# Using the VS Code task
Run FastAPI server

# Or manually
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 3. Test Integration

Run the integration test script:

```bash
./test_exam_room_integration.sh
```

## 📊 API Endpoints

### 🔒 Protected Endpoints (Admin Authentication Required)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/exam-room/assign` | Create new exam room assignment |
| PUT | `/exam-room/{room_id}` | Update exam room assignment |
| DELETE | `/exam-room/{room_id}` | Delete exam room assignment |
| GET | `/admin/analytics/registration-trends` | Get registration trends |
| GET | `/admin/analytics/college-distribution` | Get college distribution |
| GET | `/admin/analytics/department-enrollment` | Get department enrollment |
| GET | `/admin/analytics/system-health` | Get system health metrics |

### 🔓 Public Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/exam-room/mappings` | List all exam room mappings |
| POST | `/exam-room/validate` | Validate student in exam room |

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Create Exam Room Assignment

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/exam-room/assign" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "room_code": "ROOM_A1",
    "room_name": "Main Hall A1",
    "index_start": "20100001",
    "index_end": "20100050",
    "capacity": 50,
    "description": "Main examination hall"
  }'
```

### Validate Student in Room

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/exam-room/validate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "face_image": "base64_encoded_image_data",
    "room_code": "ROOM_A1"
  }'
```

### Get Analytics Data

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/admin/analytics/registration-trends" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## 🔍 Validation Logic

The system implements comprehensive validation:

1. **Face Recognition**: Matches uploaded face against registered students
2. **Index Number Validation**: Verifies student's index number falls within room's assigned range
3. **Room Assignment Check**: Ensures student is in the correct exam room
4. **Logging**: Records all validation attempts with timestamps and results

## 📱 Response Format

### Successful Validation
```json
{
  "status": "valid",
  "beep_type": "confirmation",
  "message": "Student John Doe (20100025) validated successfully in ROOM_A1",
  "student_info": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "index_number": "20100025",
    "college": "College of Engineering",
    "department": "Computer Engineering"
  },
  "room_info": {
    "room_code": "ROOM_A1",
    "room_name": "Main Hall A1",
    "index_range": "20100001-20100050"
  }
}
```

### Invalid Validation
```json
{
  "status": "invalid",
  "beep_type": "warning",
  "message": "Student not assigned to this room. Please check room assignment.",
  "error_type": "wrong_room"
}
```

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### Dashboard Components Needed

1. **Exam Room Management Panel**
   - Room assignment form
   - Room listing with edit/delete options
   - Index range validation

2. **Real-time Validation Interface**
   - Camera integration for face capture
   - Room selection dropdown
   - Validation result display with audio feedback

3. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Charts for registration trends
   - Distribution pie charts
   - System health indicators
   - Real-time statistics

### Recommended Libraries

- **React**: For frontend framework
- **Chart.js/Recharts**: For analytics visualization
- **React Webcam**: For camera integration
- **Axios**: For API calls
- **Material-UI/Chakra UI**: For UI components

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Exam room management requires admin JWT tokens
2. **Validation**: Room validation is public but logs all attempts
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limits on validation endpoint
4. **CORS**: Configure CORS settings for production deployment

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Migration Errors**
   - Ensure Supabase connection is active
   - Check if tables already exist
   - Verify permissions for table creation

2. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify admin user exists in database
   - Check JWT token validity
   - Ensure proper Authorization header format

3. **Face Recognition Issues**
   - Verify face_encoding exists for students
   - Check base64 image format
   - Ensure adequate lighting in images

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Test admin login
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@knust.edu.gh", "password": "Admin123!"}'

# Check exam room mappings
curl http://localhost:8000/exam-room/mappings
```
