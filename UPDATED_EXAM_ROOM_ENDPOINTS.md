# 🏛️ Updated Exam Room Management Endpoints

## 📋 Overview

The updated exam room management system now properly assigns students to rooms based on their **index number ranges**. When you create a room assignment like `8551521 - 8552721` for `FF1`, all students with index numbers in that range are automatically assigned to that room.

## 🎯 **Core Concept**

- **Index-Based Assignment**: Students are assigned to rooms based on their index numbers
- **Automatic Assignment**: No manual student-to-room assignment needed
- **Range Validation**: System ensures index ranges don't overlap between rooms
- **Student Count**: Each room shows how many students are actually assigned
- **Capacity Monitoring**: Track room utilization and overcapacity warnings

## 🎨 **Frontend Implementation**

### **Admin Room Assignment Workflow**

```javascript
// Step 1: Preview assignment before creating room
const previewAssignment = async (indexStart, indexEnd) => {
    const response = await fetch(
        `/exam-room/assignments/preview?index_start=${indexStart}&index_end=${indexEnd}`,
        {
            headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
        }
    );
    const result = await response.json();
    
    // Show preview to admin
    const preview = result.data[0];
    showPreview({
        totalStudents: preview.total_students,
        studentsPreview: preview.students_preview,
        hasMore: preview.has_more
    });
    
    return preview;
};

// Step 2: Create room assignment
const createRoomAssignment = async (roomData) => {
    // First preview the assignment
    const preview = await previewAssignment(roomData.index_start, roomData.index_end);
    
    // Show confirmation dialog
    const confirmed = await showConfirmation(
        `Assign ${preview.total_students} students to ${roomData.room_name}?`
    );
    
    if (confirmed) {
        const response = await fetch('/exam-room/assign', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            },
            body: JSON.stringify(roomData)
        });
        
        const result = await response.json();
        const room = result.data[0];
        
        showSuccess(
            `Room ${room.room_code} created with ${room.assigned_students_count} students assigned!`
        );
        
        return room;
    }
};

// Step 3: View room details with students
const viewRoomDetails = async (roomId) => {
    const response = await fetch(`/exam-room/mappings/${roomId}/students`, {
        headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    const roomDetails = result.data[0];
    
    displayRoomDetails({
        room: roomDetails,
        students: roomDetails.students_in_range,
        utilization: roomDetails.capacity_utilization,
        isOvercapacity: roomDetails.is_overcapacity
    });
};
```

### **Room Management Dashboard**

```javascript

    const [rooms, setRooms] = useState([]);
    
    const fetchRooms = async () => {
        const response = await fetch('/exam-room/mappings');

        setRooms(data.data);
    };

                            </div>
                        </div>

    );
};
```

## 🎯 **Key Improvements**

1. **✅ Index-Based Assignment**: Students automatically assigned based on index ranges
2. **✅ Student Count Display**: Shows actual number of students in each room  
3. **✅ Capacity Monitoring**: Tracks room utilization and overcapacity warnings
4. **✅ Preview Function**: Admin can preview assignments before creating rooms
5. **✅ Detailed Student Lists**: View all students assigned to specific rooms
6. **✅ Range Validation**: Prevents overlapping index ranges between rooms

## 📝 **Example Usage**

```bash
# Admin creates room for Engineering students
POST /exam-room/assign
{
    "room_code": "FF1",
    "room_name": "Engineering Hall 1", 
    "index_start": "8551521",
    "index_end": "8552721",
    "capacity": 50
}

# System automatically assigns all students with index numbers 8551521-8552721 to FF1
# Response shows: "45 students assigned to FF1"

# During exam, student with index 8551650 walks into FF1
POST /exam-room/recognize
{
    "face_image": "student_face_data",
    "room_code": "FF1"
}

# System validates: 8551650 is within range 8551521-8552721 ✅
# Response: "✅ Confirmation beep - Student verified in correct room"
```

This updated system now properly handles **index-based room assignments** as requested! 🎉
